## About

This is a random recipe generator app that uses the Edamam Recipe Search API to provide the necessary data. The app is created in vanilla JavaScript and its main objective is to help me learn front-end development through the creation of demo projects.

### This app is still work in progress!

## Features that still need to be added:

- [ ] Removing any ingredient from the inredient list
- [ ] Form validation techniques
- [ ] Error catching management

## Installing the repo:

To install it, simply fork this repository and use npm install in order to get all the necessary modules for it to work.
